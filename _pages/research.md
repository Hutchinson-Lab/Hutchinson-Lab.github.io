Geospatial learning problems are frequently characterized by spatial autocorrelated input features and by the potential covariate shift at test time.
These realities violate the classical iid assumption which most cross-validation methods rely on to estimate the generalization error. We investigate theoretical criteria for unbiased cross-validation estimators in the geospatial setting, develop a framework for choosing an appropriate strategy to estimate model error, and develop new cross-validation algorithms for challenging scenarios.

## Environmental Predictors from Satellite Imagery

Species distribution models (SDMs) generally require environmental variables as model inputs. It is common to use satellite imagery to derive the environmental variables, however, there are a number of methods for turning satellite data into environmental variables. We compare different methods for establishing environmental variables from satellite imagery. Specifically, we evaluate 1) summarizing the raw bands and transformations and/or indices of the raw bands (e.g., Tasseled Cap transformations, NDVI, EVI) and 2) directly analyzing the satellite imagery with convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
