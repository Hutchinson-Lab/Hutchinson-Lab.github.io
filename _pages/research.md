Geospatial learning problems are frequently characterized by spatial autocorrelated input features and by the potential covariate shift at test time.
These realities violate the classical iid assumption which most cross-validation methods rely on to estimate the generalization error. We investigate theoretical criteria for unbiased cross-validation estimators in the geospatial setting, develop a framework for choosing an appropriate strategy to estimate model error, and develop new cross-validation algorithms for challenging scenarios.
