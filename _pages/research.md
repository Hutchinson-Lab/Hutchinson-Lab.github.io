Geospatial learning problems are frequently characterized by spatial autocorrelated input features and by the potential covariate shift at test time.
These realities violate the classical assumption of independent identically distributed data, which most cross-validation algorithms rely on in order to estimate the generalization performance of a model. We investigate theoretical criteria for unbiased cross-validation estimators in the geospatial setting, develop a framework for choosing an appropriate strategy to estimate model error, and develop new cross-validation algorithms for challenging scenarios.
